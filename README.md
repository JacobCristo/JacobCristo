Hi there ! My names Jacob, and I'm a current RIT Game Design and Development student. 
I am an artist and a programmer, and I love video games and making them come to life.
Currently I am working on a number of projects, 
and experimenting with programs like Godot, Asesprite, and Soundtrap to push the limits of my creativity.

My current projects include a pinball boss-rushing action game called "**Twinball**", which I am working on with a team of two friends. 

I'm also working on a game called **"Ghosting"**, which is a fun "internet simulator" story game that I'm working on with another good friend of mine.

Finally, I am working on an extension of a class project, a platformer called "**Happy Birthday Baron!**", which is a simple, goofy platformer following a sad little vampire named Baron and his worst birthday ever.

I'll definitely be working on more games over time as I go through classes, so more will likely be added to this list soon!
